# SamplerPy ⏺️
---

## What is it?

SamplerPy is an application for Windows that uses WASAPI to record desktop audio with a press of a button.

## What do you need?

Windows, Python and some dependecies...

## Why?

Honestly, when you hear a cool sound, no-one wants to open Audacity and go through all that exporting and yada yada...

So I made this :)

## How do I use this?

Open the program and it records what's playing, easy.  

> If it's not opening, run "install_dependancies.bat".
