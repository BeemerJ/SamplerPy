# SamplerPy
Desktop Audio Sampling Program
---

## What is it?

SamplerPy is an application for Windows that uses WASAPI to record desktop audio with a press of a button.

## What do you need?

Windows, Python and some dependecies...

## Why?

Honestly, when you hear a cool sound, no-one wants to open Audacity and go through all that exporting and yada yada...

So I made this :)
